It is our pleasure to announce [Version 1.0.3 of the Speckle@Arup Connector](https://github.com/arup-group/speckle-sharp/releases/download/1.0.3.13125/Speckle%40ArupInstaller-v1.0.3.13125.exe). This update includes the following

Structural Suite:
* Several additions and fixes to the GSA connector (including support for scaling and export of combination case results)

Grasshopper client:
* A nested properties query component in the Grasshopper connector, which can be used for easier filtering of received stream data
* Other improvements to existing connector components

General:
* A minor fix to the auto updater (hopefully no more popups from the auto updater on restart - sorry about this!)
* Other minor fixes and improvements for the Bentley connectors (including a fix for point conversions), the ETAB connector (including increased coverage of ETABS objects, including results) and Rhino, Revit, Dynamo and AutoCAD/Civil3D connectors

All Arup staff should use this all-in-one installer and everyone else is welcome to use it as well!

You may get a warning screen from Windows Defender due to the executable being downloaded from the internet. It is safe to ignore this message and continue installation (and yes, we are working on removing the warning!).
