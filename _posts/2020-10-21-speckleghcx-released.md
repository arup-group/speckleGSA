We have released an alternative implementation of the Speckle Grasshopper plugin that we are calling Speckle Grasshopper Community Extensions or SpeckleGrasshopper-cx. [You can find the latest version on the Github releases page here.](https://github.com/arup-group/SpeckleRhino/releases)

SpeckleGrasshopper-cx is a refinement of the main SpeckleGrasshopper plugin based upon user feedback within Arup. It specifically smooths structural model creation.

Highlights include:

* The naming and grouping of the components have been simplified. Rarely used components have been hidden from the main task bar.
* Property references are now easier to assign, simply wire in the appropriate Speckle object to an input ending in 'Ref' and the application id of the object will be automatically extracted from the Speckle object and assigned appropriately.
* Querying properties within the properties dictionary (where most structural data resides) has been unified with querying top-level fields.

The documentation on this site has been written using the SpeckleGrasshopper-cx components.
