The documentation (this site!) is being given an overhaul! Now all documentation and training material for SpeckleGSA will be hosted here rather than the main Speckle site. This lets us provide more
detailed documentation without overwhelming the main Speckle site.

Currently the information is just a port of the existing material, but look out in the future for more detailed user guides including sample files and videos.
