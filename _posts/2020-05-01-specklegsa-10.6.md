We are pleased to announce the release of SpeckleGSA version 11. The version of SpeckleGSA works with GSA 10.0. The main improvement is a speed increase in receiving and sending models. There are also a number of bug fixes.

SpeckleGSA 11 is bundled in the [SpeckleStructuralInstaller v0.14](https://github.com/arup-group/specklestructuralsuite-installer/releases/tag/0.14.0.29852).

This release also contains the changes from SpeckleGSA 10.6:

* Allowing GSA file opening and logging into Speckle to be done in any order
* Better display of errors in processing
* Closing GSA instance doesn't cause the application to crash anymore
* Cancellation of sending is now offered if results are selected but design layer is chosen, or if analysis layer is chosen with continuous sending
* Fixed bug (corresponding with change in the kit) which prevented some MiscResults to be sent
* Add layer of retry functionality around sending of data to the server
 
and SpeckleStructuralKit 1.0.24
 
* Added point distances to the Assembly class, allowing you to customise the points along the assembly for analysis
* Added StructuralStorey
* Added StructuralLoadPlane, for which either an axis or storey reference can be assigned and which maps to a grid surface in GSA
* Added Structural0DLoadPoint, which references a StructuralLoadPlane and maps to grid point loads in GSA
* Altered Structural1DLoadLine to reference a StructuralLoadPlane
* StructuralLoadPlanes can be shared between grid point and grid line loads, although not area loads (yet)
* Blank and invalid references to other objects now result in assigning the next free record number, rather than zero
* Small performance improvement by changing property getters whose values are stored in the Properties dictionary to reduce the exceptions thrown within
* Made result classes more consistent by ensuring they all have load case and description fields
* Fixed bug (corresponding with change in the app) which prevented some MiscResults to be sent
