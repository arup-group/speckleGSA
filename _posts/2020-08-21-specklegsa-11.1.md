We are pleased to announce the release of SpeckleGSA version 11.1, which is included in the [latest Speckle Structural Suite Installer](https://github.com/arup-group/specklestructuralsuite-installer/releases/tag/0.14.3.37858). The version of SpeckleGSA supports GSA 10.**1**. Big thanks to [Nic Burgers](https://github.com/nic-burgers-arup) and [Hugh Groves](https://github.com/HughGrovesArup) for this amazing release! 

Key changes in SpeckleGSA 11.1 and SpeckleStruturalKit 1.1.4 are:

* Support for GSA 10.1
* Dropped support for GSA 10.0. (If you are still using GSA 10.0, do not upgrade)
* Improved support for walls with opennings (new meshing algorithm!!)
* Support for lists
* Support for gridlines and grid systems
* Bug fixes for loadings, releases
* Improved messages in the UI
* UI improvements for those of you using small screens (the SpeckleGSA window now fits on a typical laptop screen!)
