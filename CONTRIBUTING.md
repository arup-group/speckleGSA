# Contributing

Thank you for sharing back to the SpeckleGSA project!

These guidelines are simple and should make it easy for you to share your improvements to SpeckleGSA with the Speckle and GSA communities!

All contributions are welcome: bug fixes, documentation, tutorials, new features!

Please set up a pull request to the `dev` branch for all contributions - this will let us discuss and review the changes before incorporating them into the main code base. If this is your first time contributing to SpeckleGSA, please fork the repo and set up a merge request from your repo.

Check out [http://makeapullrequest.com/]() or [https://www.firsttimersonly.com/]() if you have never contributed to an open source project before!

All contributions should be make SpeckleGSA better, so please make sure that your changes do not break SpeckleGSA, or remove existing functionality.

If you would like to make a significant change, please open an issue to discuss it first and be sure to tag @daviddekoning and @nic-burgers-arup.
