When working in a corporate environment it is always best practice to organise your streams using the Speckle web interface.

Head to your speckle server, then create a new project from the 'projects' tab.

![New project]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/user_docs/organise/projects.png)

Then all you need to do is fill in the relevant details:

* Project name
* Project code
* Tags
* Users
* Streams

If you are an Arup employee please enter your job number as the project code. Showing that Speckle is being used by real projects lets us demonstrate the value of Speckle and helps us guarantee future funding for maintenance, developer support, and new features.
