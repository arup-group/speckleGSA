If you are interested in exploring the SpeckleStructural schema either [take a look at the C# code](https://github.com/arup-group/SpeckleStructural/tree/master/SpeckleStructuralClasses) or download the schema in [JsonSchema format]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/schema/SpeckleStructuralJsonSchema.zip).

The JsonSchema has been automatically created from the C# codebase. As such each object contains information related to the base Speckle objects that can likely be ignored.
