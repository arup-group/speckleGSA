Grasshopper is one of the most flexible places to create SpeckleStructural models from.

This tutorial will walk you through the basic process:

* Creating a model
* Sending it to GSA
* Running
* Sending result from GSA
* Viewing those results in Grasshopper

<i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> This tutorial assumes you are comfortable with creating, modifying, and converting Speckle objects in Grasshopper. To learn more, please read the [Speckle Grasshopper tutorial](https://speckle.systems/docs/clients/grasshopper/schema-builder/).

This tutorial uses the [Arup Speckle Grasshopper components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0). These components (in paticular the new 'ApplicationId' component) make it significantly easier to create SpeckleStructural models
