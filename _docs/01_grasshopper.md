Grasshopper is one of the most flexible places to create SpeckleStructural models from.

This tutorial will walk you through the basic process. Alternatively, an example grasshopper script that contains common geometric and structural objects can be found [here](https://github.com/arup-group/speckle.arup.com/tree/main/docs/grasshopper/examples).

* Creating a model
* Sending it to GSA
* Running
* Sending result from GSA
