Grasshopper is one of the most flexible places to create SpeckleStructural models from.

This tutorial will walk you through the basic process:

* Creating a model
* Sending it to GSA
* Running
* Sending result from GSA
* Viewing those results in Grasshopper

This tutorial uses the 'Speckle Grasshopper-cx' components - [the latest version of these components can be found on the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/arup-group/SpeckleRhino/releases). This alternative set of Speckle Grasshopper components have quality-of-life improvements that make it significantly easier to create SpeckleStructural models
