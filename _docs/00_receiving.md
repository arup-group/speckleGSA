Before you can receive a stream, you first need to create/open a GSA file in the GSA tab so the `SpeckleGSAV2` application and GSA can communicate (see screenshot Receiving 01).

**Only files opened in the GSA tab are accessible by the SpeckleGSAV2 application.**

Receiving streams can be done through the Receiver tab. Add the stream ID of the stream you wish to receive using the `Add Receiver` button. Next, click on  the `Receive` button to start receiving (see screenshot Receiving 02).

Within the Settings tab (see screenshot Receiving 03), there are two options to change how the sender operates.
- The `Coincident Node Allowence` specifies the distance of 2 nodes in order to coincide them.
- The `Distance units` specifies in which units this distance is defined.

At the bottom of this page there is a gif which shows the receiving process.
