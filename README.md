Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/arup-group/specklestructuralsuite-installer/releases).

## Usage

Once SpeckleGSA is installed, run the program directly. It will take care of openning GSA - you cannot access SpeckleGSA if you run GSA directly.

- Server:
    - Allows users to login to a SpeckleServer
- GSA:
    - Create or open a GSA file
- Sender:
    - Sends model to a SpeckleServer
- Receiver:
    - Receive stream(s) from a SpeckleServer
- Settings
